Modified book requirements with discrete math
City, Country (Injective / no-collision version):
Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name.
The function should return a single string that uniquely represents the pair using
a length-prefixed, injective format:

<len>:<city>|<len>:<country>

For example, calling the function with 'Rio de Janeiro' and 'Brazil' should return:

14:Rio de Janeior|6:Brazil

Store the function in a module called city_functions.py.

Create a file called test_cities.py that tests the function you just wrote
(remember that you need to import unittest and the function you want to test).
Write a method called test_city_country() to verify that calling your function
with values such as 'santiago' and 'chile' results in the correct string.
Run test_cities.py, and make sure test_city_country() passes.

FUNCTION CityCountryInjective(city, country)
    cityPart    <- EncodeWithLength(city)
    countryPart <- EncodeWithLength(country)

    // injective pairing: Enc(city) | Enc(country)
    RETURN cityPart + "|" + countryPart
